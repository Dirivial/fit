# Fit - It's in the name

## Todo

### Workout

- [ ] Deleting a workout should remove it from the list of workouts + redirect user to workout list. (I didn't do this because routing caused some other issue, if I remember correcly)

### Analysis

- [ ] There should be an indicator of when deleting is done.
- [ ] Show more stats, not just when a workout has been performed
- [ ] Filter for a specific exercise
