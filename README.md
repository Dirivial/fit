# Archiving as of 2023-02-17
When porting to mobile I will probably change quite a lot in the architecture, flow and look of the app. This led me to the decision of [creating a new repo](https://github.com/Dirivial/exercito). I'll keep this in case I want to look at how I solved some stuff but I'll never update the code. The website is taken down as well.
